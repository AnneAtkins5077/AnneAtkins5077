## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository focused on learning and experimenting with WebAssembly (Wasm) and Rust integration in front-end development. This space documents my journey into low-level performance optimization, cross-language integration, and the future of web development through the lens of Rust-powered WebAssembly.

As a front-end developer with a strong foundation in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, Iâ€™ve become increasingly interested in pushing the boundaries of what the browser can doâ€”especially in terms of speed, efficiency, and performance. WebAssembly offers a new frontier for building fast, secure, and portable applications, and Rustâ€™s strong safety guarantees and modern tooling make it an ideal language to explore this potential.

This repository serves as a hands-on learning lab where I experiment with compiling Rust code to WebAssembly and integrating it into front-end workflows. Projects range from small proof-of-conceptsâ€”like using Rust for image processing or number crunchingâ€”to larger architectural explorations, such as building hybrid web apps where Rust and JavaScript work together seamlessly.

My focus is on understanding not just how to use Rust with WebAssembly, but when and why it makes sense in a front-end context. You'll find code samples, setup guides, and reflections on performance gains, tooling challenges, and development ergonomics. I aim to write modular, well-documented code that others can learn from or build upon.

Whether you're a web developer curious about WebAssembly, a Rustacean looking to explore browser-based applications, or someone interested in the intersection of system-level speed and modern UIs, I hope you find this repository helpful. Feedback, suggestions, and collaboration are always welcome as I continue learning and building in this exciting space.
